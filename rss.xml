            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Unlocking the Brain with New Stimulation Technologies - Future Crunch</h1><p>In some of the more obscure corners of the online tech community, you may have heard predictions that the human brain will be able to connect directly to the internet by 2030. Although these predictions still feel a lot like sci-fi, advances in brain related technology have already moved us far closer to that goal than almost anyone realizes.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/083262a0c8815ea8a12b0bd65947fd9ff0e426d8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why the Internet of Things Matters in the Fight Against Domestic Violence - Future Crunch</h1><p>Advances in technology are both a blessing and a curse for the targets of domestic violence. New 'smart' technology can make it easier for them to contact help and document the abuse - but equally, it can be misused to monitor their activities, eavesdrop on their conversations and even track their location in real time.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d02d89bce6502c942bca3792079bda1aa863aa71.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How an Indigenous-Owned Company is Pioneering Renewables Technology in Australia - Future Crunch</h1><p>Renewables in Australia are a hot topic, not only because they are a necessary path away from fossil fuel dependence, but because of the perceived volatility towards the sector from the country's current government. Individuals and small organisations, fed up with the lack of leadership, have decided to move ahead anyway.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/36558cb132d7ef4f4b1613b08abad7dcc6bed6e7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Democratisation of Advanced Technologies - Future Crunch</h1><p>Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is the implications of the democratisation of advanced technology.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why We Should Be Optimistic About the Future - Future Crunch</h1><p>For many people the answer is of course, to be realistic.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The media and our politicians know we have an evolutionary hangover called fear - Future Crunch</h1><p>Don't let them take advantage of it This is an article about pessimism. More specifically it's about why people feel so negative about a world that by almost all accounts is improving.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Big Data: Separating Hype from Reality - Future Crunch</h1><p>One the things I like most about being a part of At Future Crunch our aim is to provide clear, critical and intelligent analysis of big future trends. We like to get behind the buzzwords and try and really understand what it's all about. Yes, we're optimistic, but we're not naive (hence the 'critical' part ).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c20687d986b7c2fb5a098628f1d1da710cb222c.jpg"></article>]]></description>
