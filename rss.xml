            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Democratisation of Advanced Technologies - Future Crunch</h1><p>Something I've been thinking a lot about recently is the implications of the democratisation of advanced technology. This is where technology comes down in cost so rapidly that machines that were once only affordable for large organisations or governments are suddenly available to the majority of citizens, en masse.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d990a3a2426a13bbfc87051707edd6c6d93cf4b7.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why We Should Be Optimistic About the Future - Future Crunch</h1><p>For many people the answer is of course, to be realistic. Someone who works in the renewable energy industry recently approached me after a talk and told me that I was being too positive and that my analysis wasn't grounded in reality.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/44b255ec7b57758e32eebaf92b3fa3dd39c8c6ff.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The media and our politicians know we have an evolutionary hangover called fear - Future Crunch</h1><p>Don't let them take advantage of it This is an article about pessimism. More specifically it's about why people feel so negative about a world that by almost all accounts is improving. For the average human being on planet earth today, life is better than it has been at any point in human history.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9d6c65047b4c115e518f99ff06f7e6427868104b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Big Data: Separating Hype from Reality - Future Crunch</h1><p>One the things I like most about being a part of At Future Crunch our aim is to provide clear, critical and intelligent analysis of big future trends. We like to get behind the buzzwords and try and really understand what it's all about. Yes, we're optimistic, but we're not naive (hence the 'critical' part ).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9c20687d986b7c2fb5a098628f1d1da710cb222c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

More than 4.8 million people have fled since 2011, and around 13.5 million people are still in need of assistance to flee widespread violence, human rights abuses and the destruction of entire communities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d1ffea922460f06731b878193b78bb519e935368.jpg"></article>]]></description>
